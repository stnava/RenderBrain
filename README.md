RenderBrain
===========

starter project for rendering brains automatically

some things need to be changed / tuned by hand

these are noted in the file renderBrain.sh by #Tweak

e.g. orientation of the image you want to register 

axis to slice and other stuff ...

` ./renderBrain3.sh brain08.nii.gz brain08seg.nii.gz RefOutput 140 2 `

gives you output starting with RefOutput* ( see included reference output ).
